These are games I'm making for a educational project.
Each will be made in around 48 hours of work.

##Dependencies:
You need glfw glew and openal. On a debian based linux distribution you could
install them like this:

`# apt-get install libglfw-dev libglew1.6-dev libalut-dev`

For OSX it's probably:
`$ brew install glfw`
`$ brew install glew`
`$ brew install alut`

Though the makefile would need to be slightly tweaked for opengl.
